== MixQL Test Environment

////
This is the start page of project's documentation, and therefore likely the first thing people read.
Main links for editors:

For testing grammar and getting to know the engine, it is better to use the SQLite image xref:getting-started-sqlite.adoc[].

To experiment with Hadoop, you can use the images from xref:getting-started-bigtop.adoc[].

=== Getting Started with Docker

* https://docs.docker.com/get-started/[Getting Started with Docker]
* https://docs.docker.com/desktop/[Install Docker Desktop]
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose Overview]

== Developing

In all images there is a preinstalled version of mixql.

But you can plug in the source and make changes on the host machine. See section "For Developers".
